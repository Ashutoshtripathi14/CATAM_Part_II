I have done my project in Python 3. The entirety of the program can be found in the single file titled "Phase and Group Velocity.py". Furthermore, a Jupyter Notebook can also be found which is the main source of all the programs. 
Each appropriate program used for different questions is separated by comments in the file.
Libraries used are:
Numpy
Scipy
Matplotlib
